 * Markdown links inside kit/ are checked here because nothing else does: lint
 * never opens a .md file, and the name audit only compares directory names.
 * A section renamed without its links repointed therefore ships silently, and
 * has done — the change that added this test repaired 32 links already broken.
 *
 * dist/ is a verbatim copy made by the build, so checking kit/ covers
 * what is published.
